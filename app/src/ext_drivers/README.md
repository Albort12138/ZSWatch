# ext_sensors
The required features of the Bosch sensors are more than the drivers in Zephyr can handle right now (if there is one).
For now I use the Bosch provided sensors drivers with a small port that makes Bosch examples run out of the box.

This should perhaps be in an out of tree Sensor driver, but for now they are placed here to make it a bit more flexible.
